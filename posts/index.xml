      <description>Chapter 1: The Havoc family # Hugo was born and raised in a poor village. He has a psychotic family line, spanning across multiple generations. His whole childhood was full of crap. His parents would get into a fight every other day. Always felt like this family was a wrecking ship, at risk of sinking with each wave crashing fight. Despite his best efforts of screaming and yelling for help, nobody ever answered back.</description>

      <description>A little bit opinion on Linux distros # Ubuntu, Archlinux, Gentoo, NixOS, Qubes OS, Tails Personally I would kill Qubes and Tails already, rather than chosing a distro designed for a single purpose, I would rather chose a general purpose. As everything in qubes can be implemented in other general purpose systems. Qubes and Tails are not alien technologies.&#xA;Using Qubes and tails in my humble opinion not doing you any good as it shouts out that you are special, or more than special.</description>
